## Visualizing Control-FREEC BAF and LogR data with IGV

[Control-FREEC](http://boevalab.inf.ethz.ch/FREEC/) is an R software "for detection of copy-number changes and allelic imbalances (including LOH) using deep-sequencing data" according to their homepage. Although this page is about visualizing Control-FREEC data, a similar software called [ASCAT](https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/labs/peter-van-loo/software) is also used in Sarek for CNV/LOH/ploidy and cell purity estimation. Explanation of BAF and LogR can be found at doi:10.1007/978-1-61779-400-1_4 .

Needs some awk massage.
