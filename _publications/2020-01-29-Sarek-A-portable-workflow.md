[This is the paper](https://f1000research.com/articles/9-63/v1) about our workflow - please cite it if you find it some use. Main points:

 - it is containerized, you can have Docker, Singularity or Conda - relatively easy to install
 - you can have HG19 or GRCh38 (latter preferred) mouse, doggo, etc. as reference
 - you can have multiple variant callers both for germline and somatic variants
 - CNVs and structural variants are also covered
 - quality control is there
